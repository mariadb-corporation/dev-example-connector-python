## Getting started with MariaDB <a name="mdb-getting-started"></a>

[MariaDB](https://mariadb.com) is a community-developed, commercially supported relational database management system, and the database you'll be using for this application.

If you don't have a MariaDB database up and running you can find more information on how to download, install and start using a MariaDB database in the [MariaDB Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/mariadb-developers/mariadb-getting-started).

## Getting started with MariaDB Connector/Python <a name="python-getting-started"></a>

Along with having access to a running instance of MariaDB and before jumping into code, you're going to need to make sure you have a few things on your machine in order to use MariaDB Connector/Python.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v. 3.6+)
* [MariaDB Connector/C](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/docs/clients/mariadb-connector-c-for-skysql-services/) (v. 3.1.5+)

## MariaDB Connector/Python Samples <a name="python-samples"></a>

This repository contains sample applications and usages that will help you gain an understanding of how to take advantage of MariaDB Connector/Python.

* [Simple API application](samples/app/flask): A Python application that uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) to expose endpoints that can be used to perform simple CRUD operations with MariaDB Connector/Python.
* [Data Visualization](samples/analysis): Using MariaDB Connector/Python, the libraries [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) are used to demonstrate data analysis and visualization.
