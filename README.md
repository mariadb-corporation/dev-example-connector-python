## Getting started with MariaDB <a name="mdb-getting-started"></a>

To be able to use MariaDB Connector/Python you're going to need to have access to a running MariaDB database instance. For more information check out the following options below. 

### MariaDB Platform <a name="platform"></a>

[MariaDB Platform](https://mariadb.com/products/mariadb-platform/) integrates [transactional](https://mariadb.com/products/mariadb-platform-transactional/) and [analytical](https://mariadb.com/products/mariadb-platform-analytical/) products so developers can build modern applications by enriching transactions with real-time analytics and historical data, creating insightful experiences and compelling opportunities for customers – and for businesses, endless ways to monetize data.

To get started using MariaDB locally you can choose one of the following options:

* [Download and install MariaDB (Community or Enterprise) directly from mariadb.com](https://mariadb.com/docs/deploy/installation/) 

* [Download and install MariaDB using the official MariaDB Community Server 10.5 Docker Image available at hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/mariadb/columnstore)

### MariaDB SkySQL <a name="skysql">

[SkySQL](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/) is the first and only database-as-a-service (DBaaS) to bring the full power of MariaDB Platform to the cloud, including its support for transactional, analytical and hybrid workloads. Built on Kubernetes, and optimized for cloud infrastructure and services, SkySQL combines ease of use and self-service with enterprise reliability and world-class support – everything needed to safely run mission-critical databases in the cloud, and with enterprise governance.

## Getting started with MariaDB Connector/Python <a name="python-getting-started"></a>

Along with having access to a running instance of MariaDB and before jumping into code, you're going to need to make sure you have a few things on your machine in order to use MariaDB Connector/Python.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v. 3.6+)
* [MariaDB Connector/C](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/docs/clients/mariadb-connector-c-for-skysql-services/) (v. 3.1.5+)

## MariaDB Connector/Python Samples <a name="python-samples"></a>

This repository contains sample applications and usages that will help you gain an understanding of how to take advantage of MariaDB Connector/Python.

* [Simple API application](samples/app/flask): A Python application that uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) to expose endpoints that can be used to perform simple CRUD operations with MariaDB Connector/Python.
* [Data Visualization](samples/analysis): Using MariaDB Connector/Python, the libraries [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) are used to demonstrate data analysis and visualization.
